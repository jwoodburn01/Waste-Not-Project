How to set up React, node and NPM on your system.

Install node
    - https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.20.0 

Open my server and run
- cd server
- npm run dev

When code is in 
    - cd server
    - npm install

    - cd my-app
    - npm install

Open my app and run 
    - cd my-app 
    - npm start

If any errors arise when running, likely another npm install will help, sometimes it doesnt install everything
Else, message me. 

Have tested it with a backup, all i did was cd server and run npm run dev, the server started. Then i had to cd my-app and run npm install before i ran the npm start.
