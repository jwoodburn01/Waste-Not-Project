# QUB CIT Final Year Project - Waste Not
Waste Not is a charitable website based on the UN's Development goals of No Poverty and No Hunger. It allows for people to post unwanted meals or unwanted items on the website, making them available for others to collect if they want it. The website also has local charities listed on its own page for users to view if they wish. To help facilitate users donating food to others I have made a chat system as well as email availability for users to communicate and have added the ability to reserve items so users can reserve items thay want to collect.
